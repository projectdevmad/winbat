        "discover":"In viticulture (grape agriculture), rootstock is the healthy root system used in grafting grapevines.<br><br>We, the founders of Rootstock, believe in nourishing and growing the wine-loving community.  We founded Rootstock so that wine lovers can easily share their tasting experiences with just a few button clicks.<br><br>Unlike traditional wine tasting apps that ask you to describe your experience with words and sentences, Rootstock lets you graphically choose from a wide range of tasting icons to describe your tasting experience.  After all, some wines are just too good to be described in words!<br><br>In addition to letting you input your tasting experiences, Rootstock allows you to search through all the tasting notes of other users on the platform.  As Rootstock grows, you’ll be able to find tasting notes from a bigger collection of wines, therefore helping you pick your next wine to drink!<br><br>We really put a lot of thought and effort into building Rootstock, so we hope you’ll enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed building it.  Also, if you’d like to leave a feedback for us to improve Rootstock, feel free contact us by email."
